This is the analysis of the One1K1 dataset from the Powell et al. 2022 dataset. <br/> 
The dataset contains 1,267,758 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects.<br/> 
The HLA status was incorporated by Chirag from the Xavier lab using HLA-Athena programs and other packages to predict and extract the B27 phenotype. <br/> 
This analysis attempts to learn the differences that HLA-B27 contributes to changes in a cellular and molecular stage only. Comparing between healthy individuals, the only difference is their HLA-B types.
